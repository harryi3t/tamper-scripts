# Tampermonkey Script Generation Rule

This rule lets you quickly scaffold a new Tampermonkey userscript and its remote loader by asking in natural language.

## Usage

Simply ask something like:

- "create a new tamper monkey script for <your description>"
- "generate tampermonkey script to <your description> matching <optional URL pattern>"

The exact wording is flexible—Cursor will figure out your intent.

## What it does

- Creates a stub userscript at `src/<slug>.js` with the standard Tampermonkey header.
- Creates a remote loader `<slug>-remote.js` that uses `@require` to point to the stub in `src/`.
- `<slug>` is automatically derived from your description (lowercased, spaces and symbols → hyphens).

## References

Look at existing scripts in `src/` (e.g., `buildkite-first-run-report.js`) for examples of headers and formatting.

## Workflow

1. Edit your logic in `src/<slug>.js`.
2. Load `<slug>-remote.js` in Tampermonkey for live-reload development.
